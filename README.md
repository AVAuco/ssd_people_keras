SSD-based people detector for Keras
===================================

Conversion made by Rafael Berral-Soler, based on the [original work](https://github.com/AVAuco/ssd_people) by Pablo Medina-Suarez and Manuel J. Marin-Jimenez.

This model relies on the Keras implementation of Single-Shot Multibox Detector by Pierluigi Ferrari found [here](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras).
